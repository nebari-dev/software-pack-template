# Software Pack Maturity & Release Readiness

This document defines the maturity levels for Nebari **first-party** software packs and the requirements for promoting a pack between levels. It applies only to packs maintained by the Nebari core team. Community-contributed packs are out of scope.

Pack state is declared in a `pack-metadata.yaml` file at the root of each pack repo. The Nebari pack dashboard ([`nebari-dev/pack-dashboard`](https://github.com/nebari-dev/pack-dashboard)) aggregates these metadata files daily and renders a single view of every tracked pack. That dashboard is the canonical place pre-sales engineers consult before demos.

## Maturity Levels

A pack moves through four sequential active levels. **Deprecated** is an orthogonal status that can apply to a pack at any level.

### Experimental
- **Audience:** Contributors only.
- **Promise:** None. May not install. May not work. May disappear.
- **Pre-sales behavior:** Do not demo. Do not mention to customers.

### Alpha
- **Audience:** Internal demos.
- **Promise:** Installs and runs the happy path on a current NIC dev cluster. Known limitations are documented.
- **Pre-sales behavior:** Can demo in customer meetings; must explicitly flag as early-stage and must not commit to availability or feature timelines.

### Beta
- **Audience:** Customer pilots.
- **Promise:** Stable enough for a customer to deploy in their own environment with engineering support. APIs and values may still change between releases.
- **Pre-sales behavior:** Can demo without caveat. Customer pilots may be offered with engineering involvement.

### GA (v1.0+)
- **Audience:** Production customers.
- **Promise:** Fully supported. Documented upgrade path between releases. We own the bug-fix and security-fix story.
- **Pre-sales behavior:** Pitch freely.

### Deprecated (orthogonal status)
A pack at any level can be marked Deprecated. A deprecated pack must:
- Set `deprecated: true` and `sunset_date: YYYY-MM-DD` in `pack-metadata.yaml`
- Have a `DEPRECATED.md` at the repo root with the migration path
- Show a deprecation banner at the top of `README.md`

The dashboard automatically moves deprecated packs to a separate table.

**Pre-sales behavior:** Do not pitch to new customers. Do not include in demos. Existing customers using the pack should be referred to the documented migration path.

## Pack Metadata File

Every tracked pack has a `pack-metadata.yaml` at its repo root. This file is the source of truth for everything the dashboard displays and for the pack's declared maturity level. The schema is owned by the dashboard repo (`nebari-dev/pack-dashboard/schema/pack-metadata.schema.json`) and may be validated locally:

```sh
check-jsonschema --schemafile schema/pack-metadata.schema.json pack-metadata.yaml
```

Key fields the checklist depends on:

- `level` — the declared maturity level (`experimental` | `alpha` | `beta` | `ga`)
- `owner` — accountable engineer's GitHub username
- `product_owner` — required when `level: ga`
- `deprecated` + `sunset_date` — see Deprecated status above
- `nebariapp_integration` — `none` | `partial` | `full` | `na`
- `scope.standalone-supported` — `yes` | `no`
- `last_promoted_at` / `last_promoted_pr` — updated on every promotion
- `last_presales_demo` / `last_presales_demo_by` — updated on every successful pre-sales demo
- `demo_notes` — current known gotchas, surfaced verbatim on the dashboard

See the full schema in the dashboard repo for required fields, validation rules, and the canonical example.

### Scope Flags

Scope flags are declared in `pack-metadata.yaml` under the `scope:` key. Each flag affects which checklist items apply to a pack at each level.

- **`standalone-supported: yes | no`** — Whether the pack is intended to install and function without the Nebari Operator (i.e., as a plain Helm chart). If `no`, standalone-related items in the checklist do not apply at any level.

Additional scope flags will be added here as they emerge.

## How to Use This Checklist

Each item below is tagged with the maturity level at which it becomes a **blocker** for promotion:

- `[E]` — Experimental
- `[A]` — Alpha
- `[B]` — Beta
- `[GA]` — GA / v1.0

To promote a pack from one level to the next, every item tagged with that level or earlier must be checked. Items tagged at later levels are encouraged but not required. Items that don't apply (e.g., auth items for a pack with no auth) should be marked **N/A** with a brief justification in the promotion PR.

## Promotion Process

A promotion is a PR in the pack repo that:

1. Updates `pack-metadata.yaml`:
   - `level` set to the new target
   - `last_promoted_at` set to the PR merge date
   - `last_promoted_pr` set to the PR number
   - `product_owner` set (required when promoting to `ga`)
2. Updates the pack's `README.md` with the new declared level
3. Has the required reviewers listed below

The dashboard regenerates daily; no manual dashboard update is needed.

Required reviewers per promotion:

| From → To | Required reviewers |
|---|---|
| (new repo) → Experimental | None — default state |
| Experimental → Alpha | Pack owner + pre-sales rep |
| Alpha → Beta | Pack owner + pre-sales rep + tech lead |
| Beta → GA | Pack owner + pre-sales lead + tech lead + product owner |
| Active → Deprecated | Tech lead |

If "product owner" has not been named for a pack, the tech lead acts as product owner for promotion purposes, but this should be resolved before the next promotion attempt.

## What the Dashboard Surfaces Automatically

Once `pack-metadata.yaml` is populated and the pack is in `tracked-packs.yaml`, the dashboard will automatically flag:

- **`stale`** — no commits in 90 days (and not deprecated)
- **`demo-lapsed`** — at Alpha+ but no successful pre-sales demo in 60 days
- **`no-product-owner`** — at GA but `product_owner` is null
- **`metadata-missing`** / **`metadata-invalid`** — the file is missing or fails schema validation

These are visibility flags, not formal blockers, but a pack with persistent flags is signaling that something in this checklist has decayed. Tech lead reviews flags weekly.

This checklist is the single source of truth for first-party pack maturity. The dashboard reflects each pack's currently declared level by reading `pack-metadata.yaml` from the pack's default branch.
